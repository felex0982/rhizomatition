# rhizomatition
This Programm is algorithmically exploring the visual quality of a root. It starts from the center and organically grows from a tree structure into a non hirachical rhizomatic structure. The underlying idea is based on a particle system. Each and every root is represented by a particle in the code which is behaving to the principle of Craig Raynolds steering behaviours for autonomous characters. Starting with twenty roots the system can easely go up to over 3000 roots till they loose their origin and become one again.
